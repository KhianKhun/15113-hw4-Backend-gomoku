For this assignment, I used Chatgpt Plus and codeX to finish it.

1. I created a "Project" and talked about some concepts and significance of 
    API, about half an hour to understand them.

2. I used another conversation to talk with GPT to understand the significance 
    and difference between Backend and Local calls

# 3. I copyed all the hw4 assignment descriptions to GPT and processed a brain storm. 

# 4. Before coding, we decides the approximate file contents and folder structures

# 5. I re-copyed the hw4 assignment descriptions to GPT and let him generate the
    corresponding codes for me, with model of deep thinking. The key prompt 
    (I think): Ignore the time restriction, based on the file structure and content
    we discussed before and the assignment description, give me the code

6. I made codeX tell me the rough implement logic of each file

# 7. Advance for AI operation. I designed a prompt algorithm for my AI model and 
    let codeX give me the code with clear expressions.
    "In the game, there should be two list, which contains the tuple. Lists represent
    the stones are already put, one for player and the others for AI. Tuples 
    represent the position information for each stones. In each call openAI API, 
    you should send two lists of tuples, gomoku rules, and the definition rules 
    for position information."

8. The other things are debugging. I describe my requirments, and codeX gives me
    updated codes.



Almost time in this homework I worked for learning about how to arrange Backend
and learn about the connection method between Frontend and Backend.
